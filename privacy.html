    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: December 2025</strong></p>

    <p>
      Edgy Loops (“we”, “our”, or “us”) develops mobile applications available on Google Play 
      and operates the website 
      <a href="https://edgyloops.com" target="_blank">https://edgyloops.com</a>. 
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use 
      our apps or website.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide it 
      (for example, when sending feedback). However, our apps may automatically collect certain 
      non-personal data through third-party SDKs. This may include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Device information (model, operating system version, device language)</li>
      <li>Interaction data (screens opened, features used, time spent)</li>
      <li>Crash logs and diagnostics</li>
      <li>General technical information such as IP address and app version (processed by our providers for analytics, advertising, security, and service delivery)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Some apps also include an optional feedback form where you can write comments about your experience. 
      If you choose to submit feedback, we may collect:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your satisfaction rating (e.g., “Love it”, “It’s ok”, “Not really”)</li>
      <li>The text you voluntarily write</li>
      <li>The time of submission and the app version</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Please avoid including personal information (such as your full name, email address, or phone number) 
      inside free-text feedback.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services We Use</h2>
    <p>To operate and improve our apps, we use trusted third-party services provided by Google:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Firebase Analytics</strong> – collects anonymous usage data to understand how users interact with our app.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Firebase Crashlytics</strong> – collects crash reports and performance diagnostics to help us identify and fix issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Cloud Firestore</strong> – securely stores feedback messages and related metadata that you choose to submit.</li>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – displays ads to free users and may collect device identifiers, IP address, and usage data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These services may process data according to their own privacy policies.<br />
      Google Privacy Policy: 
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a><br />
      AdMob Privacy Information:
      <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543</a>
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve app performance, design, and stability</li>
      <li>Diagnose crashes and technical issues</li>
      <li>Analyze usage patterns to make better product decisions</li>
      <li>Display ads to free users and support app monetization</li>
      <li>Understand overall user satisfaction and respond to feedback</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Advertising and Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>
      Our apps may display ads to users who are using the free version of the app. Ads are provided by Google AdMob.
    </p>
    <p>
      We offer an optional subscription that removes all ads and unlocks unlimited access to app features.
      A free trial may be available before the subscription renews at the stated monthly price.
      Subscription management and cancellation are handled through your Google Play account.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Local Notifications</h2>
    <p>
      Some apps may offer optional local reminders (for example, to remind you to continue a daily streak). 
      These notifications are scheduled and handled entirely on your device. 
      No personal data is sent to external servers for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can enable or disable notifications at any time through the app settings or your device system settings.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information. Data is shared only with the third-party 
      services listed above (including Firebase and AdMob) for analytics, crash reporting, advertising,
      secure storage of feedback, and other essential app functions.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain anonymous analytics, crash data, advertising data, and feedback only as long as necessary to 
      analyze trends and improve app performance and user experience. Because we do not require 
      an account or collect direct identifiers, we generally cannot link this data to specific individuals.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our apps are intended for a general audience and are not specifically directed at children 
      under 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you 
      believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You may:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose not to submit optional feedback messages</li>
      <li>Control ad personalization and certain analytics settings through your Google account or device</li>
      <li>Disable notifications via your device’s settings</li>
      <li>Subscribe to remove ads and manage or cancel subscriptions via Google Play</li>
      <li>Contact us for questions regarding your data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any changes will be reflected here with 
      an updated “Last updated” date.
